This folder contains the examples and databases that are found in:

http://www.hydrochemistry.eu/pub/pitzer_db/appendix.zip

which is a link provided in the supplementary PDF file of the Appelo (2015) (Applied Geochemistry) paper.

Many of these examples also exist in the `phreeqc` folder created when installing the `phreeqc3.Installer.exe`, which can be downloaded from:

https://www.hydrochemistry.eu/ph3/index.html

However, it seems that over the years some modifications happeneded (e.g., the folder `appelo-AG15-appendix/Anhydrite` is not present in the examples delivered with `phreeqc3.Installer.exe` as of Jan 7th 2023).
